					The recently developed next-generation sequencing technology has revolutionised the field of genomics and is widely used in various applications. However, the rapid advancements in this technology pose great challenges to computational and statistical methods used for data analysis. To meet the continuously changing requirements existing methods need to undergo constant improvement and new methods have to be developed. In this regard, the academic environment constitutes the pioneering forefront devising innovative solutions to emerging problems and challenges in data analysis. In order to maintain our state-of-the-art standard our company maintains a strong connection to different academic research institutions, including University of Cambridge, University of Zurich, ETH Zurich and Harvard University, where our experts follow the rapidly evolving field and, furthermore, involve in research-driven development of new methods. Our knowledge transfer concept constitutes a bridge between academia and industry and enables us to offer cutting edge know-how in synchrony with scientific progression of top research institutions worldwide.
