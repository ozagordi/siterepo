_If the blog hasn't been updated in two weeks, then the blogger is dead_,
says an old internet rule. We will be trying to follow a slightly relaxed
version of the above rule, so a one month old post won't mean that we shut down.

These pages will contain informal opinions on recent advances of technologies,
new tools that have appeared somewhere in the vast academic literature, old and
new statistical methods. They will also host some occasional formal message from
our company.

So, thanks for visiting us and see you soon.
