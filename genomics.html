					Since Frederick Sanger developed his method for
					DNA sequencing, in the late '70s, science acquired a powerful
					technique to investigate the basic processes that govern
					life. As a matter of fact, one of the largest scientific
					endeavours of the last thirty years has been the sequencing
					of the human genome, the completion of which was announced
					in 2003 after a twenty year long international effort.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">
					The sequencing technologies have advanced in the last few
					years at great speed, and some platforms are now able to
					produce gygabites of data in a single run. In order to
					make sense of this amount of sequences, a set of
					dedicated computational tools have been developed by
					computational biologists.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify"> At enGene Statistics we can provide
					multi-year experience in the planning and analysis of your
					genomics experiment, be it a ChIP-Seq or RNA-Seq. Our team
					has been primarily involved in designing and perfroming
					experiments, as well as developing statistical and
					computational tools to analyse the results. Communication
					is of paramount importance to us, and we strive to document
					and explain the analysis we perform for you. Whether you
					have to write an internal report or a manuscript for a
					scientific journal, we assist you in describing your study.
